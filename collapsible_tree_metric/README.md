![Collapsible Tree Metric Image](collapsible_tree_metric.PNG)

**How it works:**
1. Create a view containing the data set including n dimensions and one measure.     
2. The last node in the tree will contain the measure value
3. Working on an update to include aggregated measures at each node/level of the tree
